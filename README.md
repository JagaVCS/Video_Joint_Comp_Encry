Almost all files are in Matlab protected mode.

Instructions to see some of the Demo results of our proposed model

1. Download all the files
2.There are two demo files named as Comp_Decomp_Demo.p and Comp_Enc_Dec_Decomp_Demo.p
3.Run Comp_Decomp_Demo.p by clicking Comp_Decomp_Demo in matlab command window to see the result(Decompression)
4.Run Comp_Enc_Dec_Decomp_Demo.p file by clicking Comp_Enc_Dec_Decomp_Demo in matlab command window to see result(Decrypted). Also you can see some of the encryption parameters.


Full Matlab code of the proposed work will be publised soon.
